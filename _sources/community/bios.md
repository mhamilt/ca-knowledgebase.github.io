Jørgen S. Dokken is a postdoctoral research associate at the Department of Engineering at the 
University of Cambridge. He is one of the developers of the [the FEniCS finite element library](https://fenicsproject.org/), 
[Dolfin-adjoint](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) and the author of the [FEniCSx tutorial](https://jorgensd.github.io/dolfinx-tutorial/).

## Amelia Gully

Amelia Gully is a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Language and 
Linguistic Science at the University of York. Her work focuses on the acoustics of speech, and 
particularly how someone's vocal anatomy contributes to the uniqueness of their voice. She is 
a member of the [UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest 
Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee.

## Jonathan Hargreaves

Jonathan Hargreaves is a Lecturer in Acoustic and Audio Engineering at the University of 
Salford. Most of his research focuses on computational acoustics algorithms, but he also has 
strong interests in loudspeaker arrays, material characterisation, and microphone arrays. He 
teaches undergraduate and postgraduate courses on computational acoustics and is especially 
passionate about communicating its core concepts in accessible ways. Jonathan was awarded the 
UK Institute of Acoustics' Tyndall Medal for outstanding contribution to acoustics research 
and education in September 2016. He is a member of the
[UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/) committee,
the [EAA Technical Committee for Computational Acoustics](https://euracoustics.org/technical-committees/computational-acoustics/),
and the IOA Research Coordination Committee.

Nick Ovenden is a Professor of Applied Mathematics at University College London. He currently 
works on wave propagation in complex media, particulary media containing contrast agents such 
as coated microbubbles. Other research interests include outdoor sound propagation, biomedical 
applications and physiological modelling. He co-leads the
[UKAN Computational Acoustics Special Interest Group](https://acoustics.ac.uk/sigs/computational-acoustics/).

Matthew Scroggs is a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering at the 
University of Cambridge. He is one of the developers of [the FEniCS finite element 
library](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [the Bempp boundary element 
library](https://bempp.com/).
